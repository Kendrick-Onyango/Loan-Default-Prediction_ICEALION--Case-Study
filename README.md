# Loan-Default-Prediction_ICEALION--Case-Study

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Credit default risk is the risk that a lender takes the chance that a borrower fails to make required payments of the loan.
The main purpose of this analysis is to predict whether a new customer can be a reliable customer. It's a way to avoid default and increase the bankâ€™s revenue. This can be used to automate approving and declining loan applications more accurately.

It is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan obligations would be satisfied or not. In these kinds of problems, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variables (s).
